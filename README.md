A humble approach to gaining insight into the influence of knowledge on playing strength in chess. Knowledge is provided in the form of established rules that are based on assumptions about what is good. Underlying spatial concepts in these rules can be applied to a position to reason about desirable moves.

###Outlook
- Analysis of educational literature for chess
- Application of this concept to other domains (e.g. source code quality)
